# RustTrajectorySim
{Experimental} I'm whipping this up to try writing GNC sim code in Rust. This will lay ground work for a bigger project.

## Dependencies
- Rust
- Cargo
- Nalgebra
- Rand

# Description/Usage
Just getting myself familiar with Rust and Nalgebra. I'm trying to write a simple 6-DoF. I will be incrementally adding fidelity in code architecture and simulation as I continue to learn rust.
